# These settings are used to filter raw reads when trimming. Reads
# that are shorter than the product of read-length( the lengths in
# basepairs) and the cut-off factor are removed.
trimming:
  read-length: 150
  cut-off: 0.8

# These settings are used to set quality control filters for the reports.
# Results from samples without sufficient coverage measures are not included in
# the visualizations or the linear regression calculations.
