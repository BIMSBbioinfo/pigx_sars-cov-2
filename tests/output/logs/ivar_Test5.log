Trimmed primers from 97.41% (23552) of reads.
82.86% (20033) of reads were quality trimmed below the minimum length of 180 bp and were not written to file.
0.21% (51) of reads that started outside of primer regions were not written to file
81.47% (19697) of reads had their insert size smaller than their read length
